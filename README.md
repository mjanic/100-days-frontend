This is my main repository where I will update code daily for my #100DaysOfCodeChallenge

https://dev.to/bigsondev/100-free-frontend-challenges-3f0

Since I am doing frontend challenges I chose Next.js as a framework

You can see the code for each day under app/day[day number] ex: app/day1, app/day2 ...
